# Web3 Wallet with Flutter and Solidity

This project is a decentralized wallet application built using Flutter, Solidity, and Ganache. The wallet allows users to deposit and withdraw Ethereum (ETH) on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with a smart contract that handles transactions securely and efficiently.

## Features

- **Deposit ETH**: Deposit ETH into the wallet using a simple and secure interface.
- **Withdraw ETH**: Withdraw ETH from the wallet with ease.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Secure transaction handling using Solidity smart contracts.
- **Blockchain Simulation**: Ganache is used for local blockchain development, testing, and simulation.
- **Flutter UI**: A clean and user-friendly Flutter front end for interacting with the smart contract.

## Technology Stack

- **Flutter**: For building cross-platform mobile application.
- **Solidity**: For writing the smart contract that handles ETH transactions.
- **Ganache**: A local Ethereum blockchain used for testing and development.
- **Web3.dart**: A Dart library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain from Flutter.
- **Truffle**: For compiling, deploying, and testing Solidity smart contracts.
